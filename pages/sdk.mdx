## Why Embedbase

Embeddings are a powerful way to represent data. They can be used to create recommendation engines, search engines, and Q&A engines. Embedbase gives you and sdk & an api to create these systems without any ML knowledge.

Embedbase is fully open-source and is designed to accompany you from your first line of code to shipping your apps to millions of users.

## What is it

This is the official typescript client for Embedbase. Embedbase is an open-source API to manage ML embeddings.

## Who is it for

- App developers who want to add ML to their apps without having to worry about the infrastructure
- ML engineers who want to prototype classification systems

## Installation

You can install @embedbase/embedbase-js via the terminal.

```sh
npm install @embedbase/embedbase-js
```

### Initializing

```ts
import { createClient } from "@embedbase/embedbase-js";
import { initPostgres } from "@embedbase/db/postgres";

initPostgres("postgres://localhost:5432/embedbase");

// you can find the api key at https://embedbase.com
// you can find a list of supported dbs at https://docs.embedbase.com/dbs
const embedbase = createClient("api-key", {
  // if you leave the db field empty, it will use embedbase's db
  db: postgres,
  embedbaseURL: "https://app.embedbase.com",
  // this allows you to add plugins to the client
  // and gives you access to `.recommend`
  plugins: ["@embedbase/recommendation-engine"],
});
```

### Fetching Embeddings

```ts
// fetching data
const { data, error } = await embedbase
  .dataset("amazon-reviews")
  .search("best hot dogs accessories", { limit: 3 });

console.log(data);
// [
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.810843349,
//       "data": "The world is going to smell very different once electric      vehicles become commonplace"
//   },
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.794602573,
//       "data": "200 years ago, people would never have guessed that humans in the future would communicate by silently tapping on glass"
//   },
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.792932034,
//       "data": "The average car in space is nicer than the average car on Earth"
//   },
// ]
```

### Adding Data

```js
const { data, error } =
  await // embeddings are extremely good for retrieving unstructured data
  // in this example we store an unparsable html string
  embedbase.dataset("amazon-reviews").add(`
  <div>
    <span>Lightweight. Telescopic. Easy zipper case for storage. Didn't put in dishwasher. Still perfect after many uses.</span>
`);

console.log(data);
//
// {
//   "id": "eiew823",
//   "data": "Lightweight. Telescopic. Easy zipper case for storage.
//          Didn't put in dishwasher. Still perfect after many uses."
//    "metadata": {
//      "created_at": "2020-10-29T12:00:00.000Z",
//      "updated_at": "2020-10-29T12:00:00.000Z"
//      "location": "https://app.embedbase.com/datasets/amazon-reviews/
//    }
// }
```
